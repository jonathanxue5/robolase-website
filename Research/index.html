        robotic laser microscope (Robolase) that can be operated in near real-time from remote sites via the internet.
        This will be both a research and an instructional tool. The prototype Robolase I was developed as a multitask
        system that employed both laser scissors (microablation) and laser tweezers (trapping). The system can be
        operated via the internet with control transferred to the user via a web page that presents a control panel
        allowing: (1) laser selection (tweezers or scissors) and operation, (2) selection of microscope imaging system
        (bright field, phase contrast, fluorescence), and (3) full control of the microscope in the x, y, and z planes
        as well as objective rotation and filter combination selection. This system Robolase II has been installed and
        is operational between the UCI and UCSD bioengineering programs. Robolase II and its future iterations will
        present even greater selection and control features for the user or collaborator. Robolase III is
        underconstruction and will allow us to study and manipulate cells and tissues like never before.</p>
